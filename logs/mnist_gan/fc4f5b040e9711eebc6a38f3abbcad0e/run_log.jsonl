{"status": "crashed", "rank": 0, "details": "module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool'.\n`np.bool` was a deprecated alias for the builtin `bool`. To avoid this error in existing code, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here.\nThe aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see the original release note at:\n    https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations", "time": 1687175648.7529242}
